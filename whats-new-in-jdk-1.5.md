#What's New in JDK 1.5

This is a PowerPoint presentation (converted to HTML) that I created to document the new language features in JDK 1.5 (a.k.a., Tiger, JDK 5, and Java 5). The following topics are presented:

* Covariant return types
* Generics
* Enumerated types (enum)
* Autoboxing
* Enhanced for loop
* Variable arguments
* Annotations
* Static imports
* New classes
